<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project was for me to learn the basics of Object Oriented Programming in Java. This is one of the first few programs I wrote back when I was learning how to code. 

But we all have to start somewhere and I would like to keep this repo public for future improvements. This program is designed to act exactly the same as the famous game 2048. It basically gives you a board and let you move around tiles adding up multiples of 2. When two adjacent tiles with the same value move in the given direction, the tiles would combine and merge into one tile. You will earn score every time you merge two tiles.



### Built With
This was a simple implementation of the original programmed in Java.
